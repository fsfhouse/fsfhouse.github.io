    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>AturUang</strong> (“the App”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data. In short, AturUang does not collect, store, or share any personal information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not require any special permissions</strong> on your device. It operates fully offline and does not request access to your files, location, contacts, camera, or any other sensitive data.</p>
    <p>Because no permissions are requested in the Android manifest, AturUang cannot access any user or device data outside the app’s internal functions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>AturUang does not collect any data.</strong> We do not gather personal, analytical, or technical information from your device. There are no background services, tracking tools, or analytics SDKs integrated in this app.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No personal data (such as name, email, or phone number) is collected.</li>
      <li>No location data or usage tracking is performed.</li>
      <li>No advertising or third-party analytics services are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Offline Functionality</h2>
    <p>AturUang is designed to work completely offline. All calculations and operations are processed locally on your device. None of your data is transmitted or stored on any external servers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since AturUang does not collect or store any information, there is no personal data at risk. All inputs and results generated by the app remain on your device and are deleted automatically when you close the application or clear app data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>AturUang does not use any third-party services, frameworks, or SDKs (such as Firebase, Google Analytics, or advertising platforms). Therefore, no user information is shared with any external party.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is suitable for all age groups and does not collect any information from children under 13 years of age, or from any user in general.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the app’s functionality changes. Any modifications will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App means you accept the revised policy.</p>
